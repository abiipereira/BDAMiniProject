# BDAMiniProject
A mini project submitted as part of the Big Data Analytics course

**Abstract:**
We aim to analyse IMDB dataset to understand the movie trends over the years.  We have exploited the opportunity provided to mine the large datasets available. We have applied Big Data technologies to analyze and discover the patterns and trends. We have used PySpark which is a collaboration of Apache Spark and Python. Apache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Python is a general purpose, high level programming language.
 
**Description of the project work**

*i. Introduction*:
The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a website that serves as an online database of world cinema. This website contains a large number of public data on films such as the title of the film, the year of release of the film, the genre of the film, the audience, the rating of critics, the duration of the film, the summary of the film, actors, directors and much more. Faced with the large amount of data available on this site, We thought that it would be interesting to analyze the movies data on the IMDb over the years.

*ii. Aim & Objective*:
We aim to explore the results of the movie dataset after processing, collecting and storing of huge amounts of IMDB data. We will analyze the dataset and identify the ratings, release years and occupations of participants. We have exploited the opportunities to mine large datasets have analysed the IMDB dataset.

*iii. Platform Used*:
Operating System: Ubuntu
Hardware: AMD Ryzen 3 1200, Nvidia GTX 1050, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD
Tools used: Apache Spark
